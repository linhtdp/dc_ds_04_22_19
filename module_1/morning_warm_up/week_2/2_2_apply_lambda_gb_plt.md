### 1. Go to https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016 and download the data 

### 2. Using command line rename the downloaded file to suicide_rates.csv then move the file (command line) to your repository 
`use 'mv' `

### 3. Load the data into pandas df

### 4. Pick only rows where country starts with U 

`use apply and lambda`

### 5. Get the names of unique countries left `use pd.unique`

### [Thoughts]: how would that be useful if we have duplicated values in a dataset? 

###  5.5. pick only 'United States' (without using apply or lambda - try using indexing)

### 6. Group by age column and sum # suicides

### 7. Change the age column to a categorical one 
`use astype`

### 8. Re-order the categories so that 5-14 years appears first 

`use cat.reorder_categories`

### 9. Draw a barplot of # suicides(y) per age-group (x) for 2015

### 10. Save plot to visualization folder we have created - using plt

### 11. Push all to your git branch.
